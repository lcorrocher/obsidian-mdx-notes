# MDX Notes

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which allows users to create and edit mdx files as if they were markdown (.md) files. Does not preview MDX.

MDX (Markdown + JSX) is a file format that lets you write Markdown content but embed React components directly inside it.
It acts as interactive, component-powered Markdown.

## Features:
- Registers .mdx file extension as markdown
- Ribbon button creates .md or .mdx notes
- File and note context menu create new .mdx notes

Forked from https://github.com/timppeters/obsidian-edit-mdx.git -> fork of https://github.com/Basil-Mori/obsidian-edit-gemini
